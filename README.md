> A collection of Dockerfiles for popular Linux distributions. Launch any of them in an interactive Docker shell with one command.
> So now you can say *‚ÄúI use Arch btw.‚Äù*

## Usage

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/photography
   cd photography
   ```

2. Build & run a distro:

   ```bash
   bash ./build.sh    #  Build the script
   ./run arch         #  Run the "arch" Dockerfile
   ```

   You‚Äôll get a fully interactive shell inside whatever OS you choose

## What's Inside?

Each folder contains:

* A `Dockerfile` with common tools preinstalled (`curl`, `vim`, `git`, `sudo`)
* A non-root user named `dev` with passwordless sudo
* Ready-to-run interactive shell environment

## Contributions Welcome
